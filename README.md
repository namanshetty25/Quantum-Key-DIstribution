# Quantum-Key-Distribution

Welcome to **Quantum-Key-Distribution**!

This repository contains my implementation and exploration of quantum key distribution (QKD) concepts. QKD is a cutting-edge field in cryptography that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to securely distribute encryption keys between parties, ensuring maximum security against eavesdropping.

## About This Project

This project is part of my learning journey into quantum cryptography and secure communications. Here, I experiment with and implement algorithms related to quantum key distribution, such as the BB84 protocol and others.

## Features

- Implementation of basic QKD protocols (e.g., BB84)
- Simulations and experiments on quantum communication
- Written as a learning project to strengthen understanding of quantum information science

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (recommended)
- Basic understanding of quantum mechanics and cryptography is helpful

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namanshetty25/Quantum-Key-DIstribution.git
cd Quantum-Key-DIstribution
```

Install any required dependencies (see `requirements.txt` if available):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the main script or notebook as described in the code or documentation to start simulations or demonstrations of quantum key distribution protocols.

## Motivation

This project marks my initial steps into the fascinating world of quantum cryptography. It was created to help me and others understand the fundamentals of QKD and how secure key exchange can be achieved using quantum principles.
